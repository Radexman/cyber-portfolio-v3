Employing the Tailwind CSS framework, I meticulously crafted custom variables tailored to optimize page performance. Following a mobile-first approach, the website is designed to ensure full responsiveness across all devices. The link shortener form mandates a valid URL entry; failure to comply prompts an error message. Upon submission of a valid URL, a brief loading screen appears, swiftly vanishing upon successful retrieval of the API response. The resulting data is seamlessly appended to the DOM for user interaction.',
