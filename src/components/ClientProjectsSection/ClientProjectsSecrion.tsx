          One notable project involved revitalizing the website for Garden Complex, where I not only refreshed its
          appearance but also enhanced accessibility and ensured consistent branding. This project highlighted my
          ability to deliver visually appealing and functional solutions while maintaining open lines of communication
          with the client.

          In another engagement, I worked closely with a language tutor to develop an interactive web portfolio. This
          project required creating detailed wireframes and adapting to evolving requirements to deliver a platform that
          effectively showcases her expertise and teaching methodologies. The resulting site has elevated her online
          presence, enabling her to connect with a broader audience and make a significant impact in language education.
