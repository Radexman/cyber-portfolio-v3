          I have worked with both companies and individual clients to deliver their desired products. It&apos;s worth
          mentioning my collaboration with Garden Complex, for which I refreshed the appearance of their WordPress
          company website and ensured accessibility and consistent branding.

          Additionally, I have been collaborating closely with a language tutor to develop a captivating web portfolio,
          offering her an additional avenue for recognition and visibility in her field. Together, we&apos;ve
          meticulously crafted a platform that not only showcases her expertise but also amplifies her unique approach
          to language teaching, providing students with a compelling introduction to her services and methodologies.
          Through this partnership, we aim to elevate her online presence, empowering her to connect with a broader
          audience and make a lasting impact in the realm of language education.
