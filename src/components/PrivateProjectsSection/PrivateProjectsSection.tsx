        Driven by a passion for continuous learning and innovation, I actively engage in private projects that combine
        educational growth with creative exploration. Currently, I am working with a small team to develop a mobile
        game, leveraging collaborative skills and innovative techniques to create an engaging experience for users.
        Additionally, I am enrolled in an online Three.js 3D programming bootcamp to further expand my expertise in
        immersive web technologies. Among my projects, I have developed the Wither RPG companion app, designed to
        enhance traditional paper RPG gameplay with immersive features. I am also conceptualizing a full-stack
        application that will enable users to log in, create profiles, and interact in dynamic ways. Each project
        reflects my commitment to pushing technological boundaries and turning visionary ideas into reality.
