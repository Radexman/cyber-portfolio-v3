        Driven by a passion for continuous learning and innovation, I am constantly exploring new technologies to create
        captivating and immersive web experiences. Recently, I’ve been diving into the world of Three.js and Blender,
        expanding my skills in 3D programming and creative design. This new hobby allows me to push the boundaries of
        what&apos;s possible in web development, enabling me to craft interactive, visually stunning environments that
        engage users in entirely new ways. In addition to this, I’m working on a variety of projects where I combine my
        full-stack development skills with my creative explorations. I am particularly focused on enhancing the
        interactivity and aesthetic quality of my web applications, ensuring that every user experience is as immersive
        and enjoyable as possible. Through these efforts, I continue to expand my expertise and contribute to the
        advancement of web technologies.
